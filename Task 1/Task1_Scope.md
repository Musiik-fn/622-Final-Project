# Task 1:  Implementation and Analysis of Search Algorithms with User Input
## Objective:
Develop Python programs that implement recursive and non-recursive versions of linear and binary search algorithms, allow user input for the list and the item to search, and compare their performances across multiple dimensions.
### Concepts Used:
Loops, conditionals, recursion, functions, user input handling, and algorithm efficiency.
## Project Structure:
1.	**User Input Handling**:
    - Implement functions to prompt users to enter a list of numbers and the item they want to search for. Ensure robust input handling to manage non-numeric inputs and other potential input errors.
2.	**Algorithm**:
    - **Linear Search**:
        - **Non-Recursive Function**: Implement a standard iterative version of linear search.
        - **Recursive Function**: Develop a recursive version of linear search.
    - **Binary Search**:
        - **Non-Recursive Function**: Implement a standard iterative binary search.
        - **Recursive Function**: Develop a recursive version of binary search.
3.	**Implementation**:
    - **Linear Search**:
        - **Non-Recursive Function**: Implement a standard iterative version of linear search.
        - **Recursive Function**: Develop a recursive version of linear search.
    - **Binary Search**:
        - **Non-Recursive Function**: Implement a standard iterative binary search.
        - **Recursive Function**: Develop a recursive version of binary search.

4.	**Performance Measurement**:
    - **Execution Time**: Measure the time taken by each function to complete the search.
    - **Number of Instructions**: Count the iterations or recursive calls.
    - **Memory Usage**: Monitor the memory consumption using the memory profiler module.

5.	**Analysis and Reporting**:
    - Compare the efficiency of recursive vs. non-recursive methods in terms of time, instructions, and memory.
    - Discuss the practical implications of these results, focusing on the trade-offs between different approaches.

6.	**Report**:
- **Introduction**: Discuss the projectâ€™s goals and the importance of the algorithms.
- **Methodology**: Detailed description of user input handling and algorithm implementations.
- **Results**: Present detailed data on the performance of each search method.
- **Discussion**: Insights into the benefits and drawbacks of each method.
- **Conclusion**: Recommendations based on performance and usability.
- **Appendices**: Include all code, error handling routines, and raw performance data.

## Deliverables:
- **Code**: Well-documented Python code implementing all parts of the project.
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed metrics on execution time, instruction count, and memory usage.
- **Project Report**: A comprehensive 10-15 page document articulating all project phases.
- **Presentation**: A PowerPoint or similar presentation that summarizes the project, methodology, key findings, and conclusions. This should be designed for a 10-15 minute presentation to the class.

**Presentation Guidelines**:
- Slide 1: Title Slide - Project title, group members, date.
- Slide 2: Introduction - Objectives and importance of the project.
- Slide 3-4: Methodology - How the algorithms were implemented and tested.
- Slide 5-6: Results - Graphs and tables showing performance comparisons.
- Slide 7: Discussion - Analysis of the results and their implications.
- Slide 8: Conclusion - Summarize the findings and offer recommendations.
- Slide 9: Future Work - Suggestions for further exploration or improvements.
- Slide 10: Q&A - Open the floor for questions from the audience and instructors.

The inclusion of a presentation will help students develop their public speaking skills and ability to present technical content succinctly, while the comprehensive report and code deliverables ensure they have a deep engagement with programming concepts and analysis techniques.
