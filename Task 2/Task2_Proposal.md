# Project Proposal: Customer Lifetime Value Calculation Script with CRM Integration and Visualization

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a Python-based script that calculates the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by accessing customer data from a SQL-based CRM system and generates insightful visualizations. 

## Objectives
- **Develop a CLV calculation script** that fetches and processes transaction data from a SQL CRM database.
- **Integrate visualization tools** to represent the data in an accessible format.
- **Compare iterative and recursive programming approaches** to implementing the CLV calculation.

## Scope
The project will focus on:
1. Designing and implementing the CLV calculation in both iterative and recursive forms.
2. Integrating with a SQL-based CRM system to fetch necessary data.
3. Generating visualizations to represent CLV data effectively.

## Methodology
### Function Design
- The script will calculate CLV using both an iterative and a recursive method to evaluate the benefits of each approach.

### System Integration
- Connect to a SQL-based CRM system to retrieve customer transaction data.

### Visualization
- Develop graphical representations of the data using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## Performance Metrics
- Execution time
- Memory usage
- Computational complexity

## Expected Deliverables
- **Code**: Python scripts for both versions of the CLV calculation.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments within the scripts explaining the functionality.
- **Test Cases**: Examples and results demonstrating the correctness of both script versions.
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluation and comparison of the iterative and recursive implementations.
- **Project Report**: A detailed report discussing the methodology, results, and insights from the project.
- **Presentation**: Slides summarizing the project, its outcomes, and strategic recommendations.
