# Task 2: Development of a Custom Function in Python Programming
## Objective:
Encourage creativity and application of learned programming concepts by designing and implementing a custom function, both in regular and recursive forms, that could be used in any application of interest to the student.

## Task Description:
Using the skills and knowledge acquired in this course, you are tasked with developing a unique function that addresses a problem or enhances a feature in a domain of your choice. This function should demonstrate your ability to integrate and apply programming principles. You are required to implement this function in **two** forms: a **regular** (iterative) version and a **recursive** version.

## Requirements:
1. **Function Design**:

    - **Innovation**: The function must offer a novel utility or improvement within your chosen domain.
    - **Relevance**: The function should logically apply the principles learned in class, such as data structures, control structures, and algorithm design.

2. **Algorithm**:
    - **Regular Function**: Develop the function using standard iterative programming techniques.
    - **Recursive Function**: Implement the same functionality using recursion, ensuring that the recursive implementation is justified and effective.


3.	**Implementation**:
    - **Regular Function**: Develop the function using standard iterative programming techniques.
    - **Recursive Function**: Implement the same functionality using recursion, ensuring that the recursive implementation is justified and effective.

4.	**Documentation and Testing**:
    - **Code Documentation**: Fully document the purpose, inputs, outputs, and functionality of both versions of your function.
    - **Testing**: Provide test cases demonstrating the correctness and efficiency of each function. Discuss any specific instances in which one implementation may be favored over the other.

5.	**Performance Analysis**:
    - **Metrics**: Evaluate both function versions on metrics such as execution time, memory usage, and computational complexity.
    - **Comparison**: Analyze and discuss the differences in performance between the iterative and recursive implementations.

6.	**Report**:
    - **Introduction**: Describe the chosen domain's function, purpose, and relevance.
    - **Methodology**: Detailed explanation of the function's workings, including both implementations.
    - **Results**: Present the outcomes of the performance analysis.
    - **Discussion**: Offer insights into the benefits and limitations of each implementation style.
    - **Conclusion**: Conclude with your recommendation on which version to use and under what circumstances.
